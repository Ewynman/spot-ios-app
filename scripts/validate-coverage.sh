# validate-coverage.sh
# Validates that code coverage meets the minimum threshold for changed files
# 
# Usage: ./validate-coverage.sh <xcresult-path> <base-branch> <coverage-threshold>
# 
# Arguments:
#   xcresult-path: Path to the .xcresult bundle
#   base-branch: Base branch to compare against (e.g., origin/main)
#   coverage-threshold: Minimum coverage percentage (e.g., 80)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0: Coverage meets threshold
#   1: Coverage below threshold or validation error
