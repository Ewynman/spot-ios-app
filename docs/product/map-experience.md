# Map experience

## Purpose

Describe map discovery: pins, clustering, spot drawer, permissions, and Pro-related map behavior.

## Audience

Product, engineering, QA.

## Current status

Map UI lives under `Spot/Views/Home/MapView.swift`, `SharedSpotMap`, `MapControlsOverlay`, `MapSpotPreviewCard`. Drawer dismiss policy is covered by unit tests such as `SpotTests/MapDiscoveryDrawerPolicyTests.swift`.

## Details

### Purpose

The **map** lets users discover Spots near a viewport: markers (and density visualization), selection, and a **spot drawer** (bottom card) for quick preview.

### Pins and clusters

Markers use branded colors from `Constants.Colors` (map marker greens, cluster fill). Clustering / soft-density behavior is implemented in map components—see `SharedSpotMap` and related utilities.

### Spot drawer / bottom drawer

- Tapping a spot opens or updates the drawer.
- Tapping a **different** spot should **replace** the selection and drawer content for the new Spot.
- **Panning/zooming** away from the selected spot sufficiently should **dismiss** the drawer (policy encoded in map view model / coordinator—keep in sync with tests).

### Pro filtering

Pro-only map filters (if present) must remain **clearly gated** behind entitlement checks and covered by tests where possible.

### Location permission

Map and discovery may request location; prior prompt state is tracked in `UserDefaults` keys in `Constants.UserDefaultsKeys`.

### Empty / error / loading

Show appropriate placeholders or errors when viewport fetch fails or returns no spots (see map view model and logs under map-related log categories).

- Exact numeric thresholds for “panned away” dismiss: see implementation next to `MapDrawerDismissReason` (or equivalent).
